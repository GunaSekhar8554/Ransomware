 Program that can encrypt any file or folder in the system.

1. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the files of a system and decrypts only after a sum of money is paid to the attacker.

2. We use key derivation functions to derive a key from a password ie we will use Symmetric encryption algorithm[AES algorithm].
         
3. Scrypt algorithm is used in the python program , Scrypt is a password-based key derivation function.

4.Modules used are:
      a. pathlib       - 
      b. os            -
      c. secrets       -
      d. base64        -
      e. getpass       -
      f. cryptography  -
      g. Fernet        -
      h. Scrypt        - 
     
 5. The functions present in the program are:
